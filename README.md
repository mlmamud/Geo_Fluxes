# FLUX-GEO  
**Multiphase Flow and Transport Modeling for Subsurface Energy and Storage Systems**

---

## Executive Summary

**FLUX-GEO** is a comprehensive, Python-driven computational framework for subsurface flow, transport, and coupled process modeling across energy, environmental, and storage applications. The platform integrates multiple, well-established numerical simulators—including **PFLOTRAN**, **FEHM**, **MODFLOW**, **VS2DI**, and **VS2DTI**—within a unified, transparent, and reproducible workflow.


FLUX-GEO is designed to support the **full modeling lifecycle**, from conceptual model development and scenario design to simulation execution, postprocessing, parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis, and decision-ready reporting. By combining solver-appropriate physics with a consistent Python orchestration layer, the framework preserves the numerical strengths of each engine while eliminating fragmentation in setup, analysis, QA/QC, and documentation.

The platform delivers **traceable simulation packages**, operational scenarios with explicit physical and engineering constraints, and **decision-ready outputs** suitable for technical review, regulatory-style documentation, and stakeholder communication. Emphasis is placed on physical realism, transparent assumptions, reproducibility, and defensible uncertainty framing, enabling robust evaluation of **groundwater flow**, **multiphase and gas–liquid systems**, **reactive transport**, **near-field and variably saturated processes**, **microfluidic and pore-scale behavior**, and **long-term system performance** across a wide range of subsurface applications.
