# FLUX-GEO  
**Multiphase Flow and Transport Modeling for Subsurface Energy and Storage Systems**

---

## Summary

**FLUX-GEO** is a computational modeling framework for subsurface CO₂ storage and carbon management, built around **PFLOTRAN-based multiphase flow and transport workflows**. The platform delivers reproducible simulation packages, operational scenarios with explicit constraints, and decision-ready outputs that directly support engineering decisions, project planning, and technical review.

FLUX-GEO emphasizes **physical realism, traceability, and reproducibility**, enabling transparent evaluation of injectivity, pressure evolution, plume behavior, trapping mechanisms, and long-term storage performance across a range of subsurface energy and storage applications.

## Capabilities

### Multiphase CO₂ Flow (CO₂–Water / sCO₂)

FLUX-GEO supports modeling of CO₂ injection and long-term evolution using the physics required for storage decision-making.

#### What I Can Do
- Injection scenarios with pressure buildup and plume migration  
- Buoyancy-driven flow and containment behavior  
- Salinity and thermal variants where they materially affect results  

---

### Wells and Operations

FLUX-GEO represents coupled wells and operational controls under realistic constraints.

#### What I Can Do
- Well injection and production scheduling, including WAG and brine extraction strategies  
- Constraint evaluation (fracture pressure limits, minimum pressure thresholds, bottom-hole pressure limits)  
- Well performance summaries and field-level key performance indicators (KPIs)  

---

### Reactive Transport and Mineralization

When permanence claims and geochemistry matter, FLUX-GEO can incorporate reactive transport to quantify mineralization potential and time scales.

#### What I Can Do
- Coupled flow, transport, and geochemistry for CO₂ partitioning  
- Tracking of CO₂ into mobile/free-phase, dissolved, and mineralized fractions  
- Mass-balance-based KPIs with clearly stated assumptions and limits  

---

### Post-Processing, KPIs, and Reporting

FLUX-GEO converts raw model outputs into decision-ready plots and tables with consistent formatting.

#### What I Can Do
- Automated plots for pressure evolution, plume footprint proxies, and well behavior  
- CO₂ mass partitioning summaries through time  
- Clear, reviewable documentation and run logs suitable for technical review

### Reproducibility and QA/QC

FLUX-GEO deliverables are designed to be rerun, audited, and extended.
